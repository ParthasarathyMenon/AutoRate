# AutoRate
An auto/taxi fare calculation app which uses Google Maps API. 
Rates can be pre-set in the app which would be used to calculate the fare.
The app also displays nearby bus stops and police stations for urgent needs. Details on the same can be obtained by clicking on the marker displaying the station.
By providing the name of a place, the shortest and driving route from current location is displayed.
For users who travel the same distance regularly, the rate can be saved for future use. These can also be shared to others using SMS so that they are knowledgeable about the cost of travel.
*BETA* For defaulters who charge more than the standard rate, a complaint system is present by which you can register a complaint about the taxi/auto. Although the complaint is currently not forwarded to the police, it can be done so in the future.
